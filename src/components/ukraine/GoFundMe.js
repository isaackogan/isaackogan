                        When war broke out in Ukraine it was a shot heard around the world. Social media showed us the
                        horrors, the bloodbaths, the sheer devastation caused by the onslaught of the invading Russian forces.
                        <br/><br/>
                        When I first saw this, in spite of feelings of helplessness, I became determined to start a
                        one-man <ExternalURL href={"/uadonate"}>GoFundMe</ExternalURL> charity
                        with the goal of aiding survivors through Humanitarian Relief.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Specifically, I wanted to help support Ukraine's 7.5 million children by raising money for <ExternalURL target="_blank" href={"https://secure.unicef.ca/page/98630/donate/1"}>UNICEFâ€™s Ukraine Emergency Fund</ExternalURL>.
                        <br/><br/>
                        They promised the following for each donation:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <div style={{"marginLeft": "15px", "borderLeft": "4px solid white", "paddingLeft": "10px", "borderRadius": "2px", "color": "rgb(240, 240, 240)"}}>
                            Your contribution will help support the response effort to the escalation of the situation in Ukraine by providing communities with safe water, sanitation supplies, urgent medical care, child protection & psychological care, educational supplies.
                        </div>
                        <br/>
                        I wanted to make it clear to myself and to my peers: anyone is capable of affecting change.
                        Even a kid, a 17yo full-time student without a driver's license. It was a matter of pulling on my strengths in spite of my weaknesses.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Through software development projects, I produced
                        a <ExternalURL target="_blank" href={"https://github.com/isaackogan/TikTokLive/tree/master/examples"}>series of programs</ExternalURL> targeted
                        towards TikTok Creators, allowing them to introduce new avenues of engagement into their livestreams. Using my software, people created everything from
                        chat bots to games in their TikTok LIVE's.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Collecting <strong>35+ donations</strong> over the span of just <strong>1 month</strong>, I raised <strong>CA$1000</strong>.
                        In working with these creators, I got to meet people from all around the world. From Poland to Spain to Mexico I was introduced
                        to unique viewpoints & experiences I had never been exposed to before.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I am so grateful to have been in a position where I could volunteer my time to aide
                        in <ExternalURL target="_blank" href={"https://unfoundation.org/blog/post/the-uns-humanitarian-response-in-ukraine-how-you-can-help/"}>Ukranian Humanitarian Relief</ExternalURL>.
                        I want to continue exploring humanitarian work; I look forward to future fundraising endeavours.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The world can be an awful place and sometimes there aren't a lot of ways that we can help, but this fundraiser taught me a lesson.
                        When something is difficult, and especially when choosing indifference is so much easier, we owe it to ourselves to try.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Regards,
                        <br/>
